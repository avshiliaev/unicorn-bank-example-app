## Intro

A sample implementation of a microservices' app: CQRS, Domain-Driven Design, REST, Event-Driven

* A detailed view of the [Domain-Driven Design](./Docs/DDD.md) applied, and its outcomes.
* A detailed view of the [React Redux Client](./Docs/CLIENT.md), and how concerns are separated using state containers.
* The overview of the [Architectural Design Patterns](./Docs/DESIGN_PATTERNS.md) used in this project.
* A possible optimization of the architecture with the [Event Sourcing](./Docs/EVENT_SOURCING.md), 
  and what the application would then look like.
