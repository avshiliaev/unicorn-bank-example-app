## CQRS pattern

More on the topic [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/cqrs)

The Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern separates read and update operations for a data store. Implementing CQRS in your application can maximize its performance, scalability, and security. The flexibility created by migrating to CQRS allows a system to better evolve over time and prevents update commands from causing merge conflicts at the domain level.

CQRS separates reads and writes into different models, using commands to update data, and queries to read data.
* Commands should be task based, rather than data centric. ("Book hotel room", not "set ReservationStatus to Reserved").
* Commands may be placed on a queue for asynchronous processing, rather than being processed synchronously.
* Queries never modify the database. A query returns a DTO that does not encapsulate any domain knowledge.
The models can then be isolated, as shown in the following diagram, although that's not an absolute requirement.

> For greater isolation, you can physically separate the read data from the write data. In that case, the read database can use its own data schema that is optimized for queries. For example, it can store a materialized view of the data, in order to avoid complex joins or complex O/RM mappings. It might even use a different type of data store. For example, the write database might be relational, while the read database is a document database.

> If separate read and write databases are used, they must be kept in sync. Typically this is accomplished by having the write model publish an event whenever it updates the database. For more information about using events, see Event-driven architecture style. Updating the database and publishing the event must occur in a single transaction.
  
**Separation of the read and write stores also allows each to be scaled appropriately to match the load. For example, read stores typically encounter a much higher load than write stores.**

Benefits of CQRS include:
* Independent scaling. CQRS allows the read and write workloads to scale independently, and may result in fewer lock contentions.
* Optimized data schemas. The read side can use a schema that is optimized for queries, while the write side uses a schema that is optimized for updates.
* Security. It's easier to ensure that only the right domain entities are performing writes on the data.
* Separation of concerns. Segregating the read and write sides can result in models that are more maintainable and flexible. Most of the complex business logic goes into the write model. The read model can be relatively simple.
* Simpler queries. By storing a materialized view in the read database, the application can avoid complex joins when querying.

> Eventual consistency. If you separate the read and write databases, the read data may be stale. The read model store must be updated to reflect changes to the write model store, and it can be difficult to detect when a user has issued a request based on stale read data.

## Choreography based Saga (instead of Orchestration Saga)

More on the topic [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/choreography)

Have each component of the system participate in the decision-making process about the workflow of a business transaction, instead of relying on a central point of control.

In microservices architecture, itâ€™s often the case that a cloud-based application is divided into several small services that work together to process a business transaction end-to-end. To lower coupling between services, each service is responsible for a single business operation. Some benefits include faster development, smaller code base, and scalability. However, designing an efficient and scalable workflow is a challenge and often requires complex interservice communication.

> The orchestrator pattern reduces point-to-point communication between services but has some drawbacks because of the tight coupling between the orchestrator and other services that participate in processing of the business transaction.  To execute tasks in a sequence, the orchestrator needs to have some domain knowledge about the responsibilities of those services. If you want to add or remove services, existing logic will break, and you'll need to rewire portions of the communication path.

### Solution

A client request publishes messages to a message queue. As messages arrive, they are pushed to subscribers, or services, interested in that message. Each subscribed service does their operation as indicated by the message and responds to the message queue with success or failure of the operation. In case of success, the service can push a message back to the same queue or a different message queue so that another service can continue the workflow if needed. If an operation fails, the message bus can retry that operation.

This way, the services choreograph the workflow among themselves without depending on an orchestrator or having direct communication between them.

Because there isn't point-to-point communication, this pattern helps reduce coupling between services. Also, it can remove the performance bottleneck caused by the orchestrator when it has to deal with all transactions.

## Materialized View pattern

More on the topic [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/materialized-view)

Generate prepopulated views over the data in one or more data stores when the data isn't ideally formatted for required query operations. This can help support efficient querying and data extraction, and improve application performance.

### Context and problem

When storing data, the priority for developers and data administrators is often focused on how the data is stored, as opposed to how it's read. However, this can have a negative effect on queries. When a query only needs a subset of the data from some entities, such as a summary of orders for several customers without all of the order details, it must extract all of the data for the relevant entities in order to obtain the required information.

### Solution

To support efficient querying, a common solution is to generate, in advance, a view that materializes the data in a format suited to the required results set. The Materialized View pattern describes generating prepopulated views of data in environments where the source data isn't in a suitable format for querying, where generating a suitable query is difficult, or where query performance is poor due to the nature of the data or the data store.
A key point is that a materialized view and the data it contains is completely disposable because it can be entirely rebuilt from the source data stores. A materialized view is never updated directly by an application, and so it's a specialized cache.
When the source data for the view changes, the view must be updated to include the new information. You can schedule this to happen automatically, or when the system detects a change to the original data. In some cases it might be necessary to regenerate the view manually. The figure shows an example of how the Materialized View pattern might be used.
